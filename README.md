This repo is a personal project that containts JavaScript Quizes, it lacks a lot to be completed but i am in the way to complete it, this is a very simple project, the name is self explanatory, there are quizes about javascript, it has levels, each level has a major difficulty (it has questions about new JS releases ES5 ES6 ES7). The levels that at the moment are complete : Level 1 and Level 2. The stack in which this project is built is: Javascript, Jquery, Boostrap, PHP.
I hope you enjoy and learn more about Js with these Quizes.
